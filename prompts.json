If the issue field is None, conclude that there are no issues with the machine, unless an issue was stated by the user. If an issue has been reported/observed, try to find the cause of the issue and provide a solution. Use these provided question answer pairs as a guide for finding the cause of the issue. If the issue is not one of the additional questions, conclude that more troubleshooting needs to be done in order to find the cause of the issue.
