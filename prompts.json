    "secondary_prompt": "Based on the issue report (provided as a json), complete the missing values by reanalyzing the image. If the issue field is None, leave the json as is, unless an issue was stated by the user. If an issue has been reported/observed, try to find the cause of the issue and provide a solution in the form of another key-value pair called 'potential_solution'. Use these provided question answer pairs as a guide for finding the cause of the issue. If the issue is not one of the additional questions, set the 'possible_solution' field as None. Lastly, use this issue to create a question for future troubleshooting based on the issue that has been recognized, call it 'posed_question'. Also, provide another field that shows whether or not the issue is solvable remotely. If there is no issue, leave this as 'None' Provide the output as exactly a JSON format: {'is_machine':'boolean','machine_type':'string', 'make': 'string', 'model': 'string' , 'issue': 'string', 'possible_solution':'string', 'posed_question':'string', 'remotely_solvable':'boolean'} (feel free to add other values in the json that make sense). If any of the string values are unable to be observed, set its value to None. Make sure the output is only the json itself; nothing else. Here is the guide:"
